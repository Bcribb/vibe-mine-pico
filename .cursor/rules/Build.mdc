description: Ensures the PICO-8 web build is up to date before every commit
alwaysApply: true

Before committing any changes, always run the web export build script:

```bash
bash scripts/build-web.sh
```

Then stage the resulting `web/` files (`web/index.html`, `web/index.js`) along with the rest of the commit.

If the build script fails (non-zero exit), do NOT commit. Report the error to the user and help them resolve it.
